This is an evolutionary algorithm designed to solve the 12 queen's problem. Through this program, you can create a genotype, mutate it by usingn insert mutation or crossover and test the fitness of a phenotype. 

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The 12 queens puzzle is the problem of placing 12 chess queens on an 12×12 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the evolutionaty algorithm so that you can improve it or simulate it on your machine to see it play out on your machine

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK

### Installing

If you do not have Java installed on your computer, install the latest JDK from here.  

```
Step 1: Install the latest Java JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads)
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once Java are installed, verify that java and javac have been installed. You can do this from the terminal
```
java --version
javac --version
```
If you do not see the version number, then you have not installed Java properly.  

To compile run: 
```
javac *.java
```
To simulate run: 
```
java Tester
```

This will run the tester file which uses methods written in the Queens class to create a genotype, mutate it and test it's fitness.
